# Operator Configuration

The operator configuration template contains many settings for the operator itself, and/or the WAAP Envoy deployments.
The template bundled in the Helm charts contains default settings from the bundled `values.yaml` file, which will 
usually have to be overridden for any custom deployments. To override the values, a local values YAML file can be used.
